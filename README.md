# Mac SE Modern Video Input Conversion

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a custom video input solution for the classic Macintosh SE, allowing modern video input (VGA/HDMI) to be displayed on the original monochrome monitor. By utilizing an FPGA and custom signal conversion logic, we breathe new life into vintage Macintosh hardware.

## Features

- Modern video input compatibility (VGA/USB-C to VGA)
- Preservation of original Mac SE monitor functionality
- Custom signal conversion using FPGA technology
- Low-modification approach to vintage hardware

## Hardware Components

- Target Hardware: Macintosh SE
- Microcontroller: Arduino
- Clock Generator: SI5351 PLL
- FPGA: Lattice STEP-MXO2-LPC
- Input Interfaces: VGA/USB-C to VGA adapter

## Technical Specifications

### Display Characteristics
- Original Resolution: 512 Ã— 342 pixels
- Monochrome display
- Unique vintage display timing requirements

### Signal Conversion Architecture
- Arduino-controlled clock generation
- FPGA-based signal translation
- Direct interface with original analog board connector

## Project Goals

1. Create a seamless video input solution for Mac SE
2. Minimize hardware modifications
3. Maintain original display characteristics
4. Support multiple modern video input sources

## Development Stages


- Got the Arduino setting the PLL working.  Check
    Spent hours struggling because Claude couldn't set it right. 
    Found example code and just had Claude write the timing data, which worked
- Got a first untested draft of the Verilog for the FPGA -- untested but compiled
    Spent an hour trying to mount the FPGA as a drive to drop the compiled .JED to it
    Turns out I need a dumb USB-A to USB-C cable and that works.  Actual USB-C doesn't
- TODO: Pick up from there and test the verilog code.
